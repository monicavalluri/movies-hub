## Summary Questions
1.  *What were the most difficult tasks?*
    
    Styling the website was difficult as I was in a dilemma to use styled components. As it took me some time to convert one of the component to styled component I did not want to go ahead with styled components. I have used plain css to style.
    

2. *Did you learn anything new while completing this assignment?*
   
   Last I worked on react was in 2019. I had to go through the documentation now to understand the latest changes. Learnt react hooks and used them in this assignment.
   
   
3. *What did you not have time to add? What work took the up majority of your time?*
   
   - I did not have time to add routing. 
   - Deciding on the best approach to do styling took some time for me. As mentioned earlier I had experimented with styled components and finally ended up with plain css.
   - Could not add tests
   

4. *How could the application be improved?*

   - Implement pagination as some search queries has more results and at present there is no way for the user to see other results. The api takes `page` parameter for page number
   - Use media queries instead of relying on just flex box for responsiveness
